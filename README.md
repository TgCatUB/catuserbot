### The Easy Way
[![Deploy To Heroku](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy)

### The Normal Way


An example `local_config.py` file could be:

**Not All of the variables are mandatory**

__The Userbot should work by setting only the first two variables__

```python3
from heroku_config import Var

class Development(Var):
  APP_ID = 6
  API_HASH = "eb06d4abfb49dc3eeb1aeb98ae0f581e"
```

### UniBorg Configuration



**Heroku Configuration**
Simply just leave the Config as it is.

**Local Configuration**

Fortunately there are no Mandatory vars for the UniBorg Support Config.

## Mandatory Vars

- Only two of the environment variables are mandatory.
- This is because of `telethon.errors.rpc_error_list.ApiIdPublishedFloodError`
    - `APP_ID`:   You can get this value from https://my.telegram.org
    - `API_HASH`:   You can get this value from https://my.telegram.org
- The userbot will not work without setting the mandatory vars.
